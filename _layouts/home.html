  My name is <b>Mohammad Sadegh Zojaji</b>, and I am a Senior/Lead full stack
  developer. This blog is a collection of my thoughts, experiences, and
  learnings in the world of web development. From front-end to back-end, from
  new technologies to best practices, I'll be sharing it all. I will also be
  writing about my journey as a developer and the challenges I face every day.
